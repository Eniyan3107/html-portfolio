<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Yoo, it's Eniyan lol.. I love listening to pop music and use Spotify the most
  out of all platforms :p
</p>

<p>
  I love watching Coryxkenshin and Moist Critikal on Youtube most of the time
</p>

<p>
  My favourite sport is Badminton and I'm pretty decent at it. I'm also a
  hardcore fanatic of PC parts and often find myself on the internet researching
  about different pc parts from time to time ;p
